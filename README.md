Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, SCSS.

Install template (“dist” + “src” folder structure) (npm i). Run the “gulp” command in terminal. We do all the work (file editing) in the src directory. Based on it, the page in the “dist” directory is built. The only thing is to manually add images to “dist/images” folder, because html, js and css are generated automatically.

Project based on the "The 2019 Frontend Developer Crash Course - HTML & CSS Tutorial for Beginners" from DesignCourse YouTube channel.
